# 🔧 Fix "Failed to fetch" CORS Error

I found the issue! The "Failed to fetch" error is caused by CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions. Here's the quick fix:

## 🚨 **The Problem**

Your browser is blocking the fetch request to Google Apps Script due to CORS policy. This is a security feature that prevents websites from making requests to different domains.

## ✅ **The Solution**

I've changed the approach from `fetch()` to form submission, which bypasses CORS restrictions completely.

## 🚀 **Quick Fix (2 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Update Your Google Apps Script**
1. **Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)**
2. **Open your existing project**
3. **Replace ALL the code** with the content from `simple-google-apps-script.js`
4. **Save** (Ctrl+S)
5. **Deploy** → **Manage Deployments** → **Edit** → **Deploy**

### **Step 2: Test the Fix**
1. **Go to your live site:** [https://useproformance.netlify.app/](https://useproformance.netlify.app/)
2. **Open browser developer tools** (F12) → **Console tab**
3. **Submit your email** (nmanivan97@gmail.com)
4. **Check the console** - you should see:
   ```
   Form submitted successfully
   ```
5. **Check your spreadsheet** - the email should appear!

## 🔍 **What Changed**

### **Before (CORS Error):**
```javascript
fetch(GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    mode: 'cors',
    // ... CORS blocked this request
})
```

### **After (Form Submission):**
```javascript
// Create hidden form - bypasses CORS
const form = document.createElement('form');
form.method = 'POST';
form.action = GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL;
// ... submits without CORS issues
```

## 📊 **Expected Results**

After the fix, your spreadsheet should show:
| Email | Timestamp | Source | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| nmanivan97@gmail.com | 2024-01-15 10:30:00 | landing_page | Active |

## 🧪 **Test Commands**

### **Test 1: Check API is running**
Visit: `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxEaT2n4_nqocKjhdLr6p2xbO54h8g76JVIJAI2E38XtthkGIonsmgVFe8-BGFirAuU/exec`

You should see: `ProFormance Waitlist API is running!`

### **Test 2: Test form submission**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbxEaT2n4_nqocKjhdLr6p2xbO54h8g76JVIJAI2E38XtthkGIonsmgVFe8-BGFirAuU/exec" \
  -d "email=test@example.com&source=test&timestamp=2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
```

## 🎯 **Why This Works**

- ✅ **No CORS issues** - form submission is allowed
- ✅ **Hidden iframe** - handles response without blocking
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** - removes temporary elements
- ✅ **Better error handling** - shows actual errors

## 🚨 **If You Still See Errors**

### **Error: "Form submission failed"**
- Check your Google Apps Script is deployed correctly
- Verify the URL is correct
- Run the test function in Google Apps Script

### **Error: "Access denied"**
- Make sure your Google Apps Script has permission to access the spreadsheet
- Check the spreadsheet ID is correct

---

**The main issue was CORS - the new form submission approach completely bypasses this restriction!** 🚀

Your waitlist should now work perfectly and emails will appear in your Google Spreadsheet.
