# üê¶üì± Twitter iOS In-App Browser - Troubleshooting Guide

## The Problem

Twitter's iOS in-app browser has extremely restrictive security policies that block most JavaScript network requests.

## Step 1: Verify Google Apps Script is Working

**CRITICAL: Do this FIRST before testing anything else!**

### Test the Script Directly

Open this URL **in Safari on your iPhone** (NOT in Twitter):

```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw_NwzIbLuY2kUNa-nN2DV7crUwJt4my-mBZEQtvjUlJBYADCta7dttvUByKP9Q3nLh/exec?email=direct-test@example.com&source=direct_test
```

**Expected result:**
- You should see a blank page or "success" text
- Check your [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-7LrlSC1cC9lv9yPyD6HziJAr2eLob2tiUITjV6ukz8/edit)
- Email `direct-test@example.com` should appear with source `direct_test`

**If this doesn't work:**
‚ùå Your Google Apps Script is NOT deployed correctly
‚Üí Jump to "Fix Google Apps Script" section below

**If this DOES work:**
‚úÖ Script is working! The problem is Twitter blocking requests
‚Üí Continue to Step 2

## Step 2: Check Google Apps Script Execution Logs

1. Go to: https://script.google.com (on your computer)
2. Open your "ProFormance Waitlist" project
3. Click **"Executions"** in the left sidebar (‚ö° icon)

**What to look for:**

### If you see executions:
‚úÖ Requests are reaching the script!
- Click on any execution to see details
- Check for errors in the logs
- Verify emails are being added

### If you see NO executions:
‚ùå Requests are NOT reaching the script
- Twitter is blocking ALL requests
- OR Google Apps Script is not deployed
- Continue to Step 3

## Step 3: Test in Twitter iOS Browser

### Option A: Use the diagnostic page

1. Open Twitter on iPhone
2. Click your Reform link (opens in Twitter browser)
3. Manually change URL to:
   ```
   https://reform-landing-page.onrender.com/twitter-ios-test.html
   ```
4. Submit a test email
5. Check the debug log on the page
6. Check Google Apps Script Executions (refresh the page)
7. Check Google Sheet

### Option B: Use the main page

1. Open Twitter on iPhone
2. Click your Reform link
3. Submit your email
4. Check Google Sheet after 5 seconds

**After testing, check:**
- ‚úÖ Google Apps Script Executions - Did new executions appear?
- ‚úÖ Google Sheet - Did the email appear?
- ‚úÖ Console logs - What errors show in the debug page?

## Fix Google Apps Script

If the direct URL test didn't work, your script needs to be updated/redeployed:

### Update Steps:

1. **Go to:** https://script.google.com
2. **Open:** "ProFormance Waitlist" project
3. **Replace code:**
   - Select ALL code in `Code.gs`
   - Delete it
   - Copy ALL code from `updated-google-apps-script.js`
   - Paste into `Code.gs`
4. **Save:** Click üíæ or press Cmd+S
5. **Deploy:**
   - Click **Deploy** button (top right)
   - Select **Manage deployments**
   - Click ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit** icon next to your deployment
   - Under "Version" select **New version**
   - Click **Deploy**
6. **Verify settings:**
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone** ‚ö†Ô∏è (this is critical!)
   - If it says "Anyone with Google account", change it to "Anyone"

### Test After Deploy:

Immediately test the direct URL again in Safari:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw_NwzIbLuY2kUNa-nN2DV7crUwJt4my-mBZEQtvjUlJBYADCta7dttvUByKP9Q3nLh/exec?email=after-deploy@example.com&source=test_after_deploy
```

Check if `after-deploy@example.com` appears in the sheet.

## Alternative Solution: Form Redirect Method

If Twitter iOS blocks ALL JavaScript methods, we need a different approach:

### What happens:
- User clicks "Join Waitlist"
- Form navigates to Google Script URL
- Google Script saves email and redirects back
- User sees success page

### Trade-offs:
- ‚úÖ Works in ANY browser (even most restrictive)
- ‚úÖ 100% reliable
- ‚ùå User briefly sees Google Script URL (< 1 second)
- ‚ùå Page navigation instead of smooth AJAX

### To implement this:
Let me know if you want to try this approach and I'll update the code.

## Debug Checklist

Go through this checklist:

- [ ] Direct URL test in Safari works
- [ ] Email appears in Google Sheet from direct URL
- [ ] Google Apps Script Executions show requests
- [ ] Google Apps Script is deployed with "Anyone" access
- [ ] Render has finished deploying (check https://dashboard.render.com)
- [ ] Tested in Twitter iOS browser (not regular Safari)
- [ ] Checked console logs on debug page
- [ ] Waited at least 2-3 seconds after submitting

## Common Issues

### Issue: Direct URL test doesn't work
**Fix:** Redeploy Google Apps Script with "Anyone" access

### Issue: Direct URL works but Twitter doesn't
**Fix:** Twitter is blocking requests - need Form Redirect Method

### Issue: "Authorization required" error
**Fix:** 
1. Run the script manually once (click ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button)
2. Authorize it when prompted
3. Redeploy

### Issue: Executions show errors
**Fix:** Check the error message in execution logs and share it

## Next Steps

Please do this in order:

1. **Test direct URL in Safari** (Step 1)
2. **Report back:** Did the email appear in the sheet? (Yes/No)
3. **Check Executions:** Do you see any executions? (Yes/No)
4. **If needed:** I'll switch to Form Redirect Method (100% reliable)

**Current Status:** Waiting for diagnostic results
